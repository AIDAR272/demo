[Intro: Justin Timberlake]

[Verse 1]
You say you got a girl
Yeah, how you want me? How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless, of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, all up in your lap
Like, is you comin' home? Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you here by 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want
